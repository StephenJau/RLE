# **RLE** #
RLE Compression practice.
This project is to practice Run Length Encoding compression algorithm.
A non marker based compression and a marker based compression will be performed seperately. 
========================
tested on ubuntu x86_64.
```
Nonmarker based: rle_no.c 	rle.h;
   marker based: rle_marker.c	rle.h;
This two different code share a common rle.h file.
command line: 
./rle [parameter] [filename]
Parameter:
	compression: -c
	uncompression:-u
filename:
	compression: any
	uncompression: entension be .rle
